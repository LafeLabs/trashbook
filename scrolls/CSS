CSS, ALSO KNOWN AS CASCADED STYLE SHEETS, IS THE LANGUAGE WHICH TELLS WEB PAGES WHAT TO LOOK LIKE!

IT CONTROLS SIZE AND TYPE AND COLOR OF FONTS, BACKGROUND COLORS, HOW ICONS AND IMAGES APPEAR, AND HOW ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE ARRANGED IN THE BROWSER WINDOW!

CSS IS THE MAGIC THAT ALLOWS THE SAME WEB PAGE TO LOAD IN A WIDE ARRAY OF EXTREMELY DIFFERENT DEVICES FROM WATCHES TO JUMBOTRONS!

CSS IS A WHOLE LANGUAGE OF DESIGN WHICH CAN BE USED TO GENERATE ANIMATIONS AND ART FROM SCRATCH WITH MINIMAL HTML AND NO JAVASCRIPT!

A LOT OF DEVELOPERS FROM THE TECH BRO CULT LOOK DOWN ON CSS!

BUT IF WE WANT A MORE FRIENDLY AND ACCESSIBLE WEB, WE SHOULD CELEBRATE CSS FOR WHAT IT CAN DO, FOR HOW IT CAN HELP MAKE VERY BARE BONES AND SIMPLE HTML WORK ACROSS  A WIDE RANGE OF HARDWARE!

CSS STYLES AN ALSO BE ACCESSED USING [JAVASCRIPT](scrolls/JAVASCRIPT)!
