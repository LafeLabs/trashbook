# JSON
 
JSON STANDS FOR JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION, AND IT IS OFTEN PRONOUNCED EITHER LIKE THE NAME "JASON" OR LIKE "JAYSAHN", WITH THE "A" LIKE THE "O" IN "ON".

THE CREATOR OF THE LANGUAGE SAYS HE DOESN'T CARE AND WE CAN SAY IT EITHER WAY!

JSON IS THE FORMAT USED FOR A LOT OF SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS! 

IT IS THE FORMAT OF MOST METADATA ON THE WEB THAT IS THE DRIVER OF INTERNET CONSUMER CAPITALISM!

IT IS ALSO A GREAT FORMAT FOR DATA!

IT IS ALSO THE FORMAT OF THE [JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS](https://jupyter.org/), WHICH ARE A GREAT TOOL FOR DOING OPEN SCIENCE!!


IN TRASH MAGIC WE USE JSON TO STORE THE LIST OF LISTS WHICH MAKE UP THE SET THAT GETS [REPLICATED](scrolls/REPLICATION) FROM SERVER TO SERVER!
