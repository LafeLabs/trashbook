# CODE REPLICATION
 

TRASH MAGIC HAS SETS OF FILES ON SERVERS WHICH CAN REPLICATE THEMSELVES!

ONE OF THESE FILES IS THE [PHP](scrolls/PHP) SCRIPT THAT COPIES THE REST!

IT DOES THIS WITH A [JSON](scrolls/JSON) LIST, WHICH IS ANOTHER OF THE FILES, THAT WAS CREATED WITH ANOTHER PHP SCRIPT!

ALL THE FILES ARE EDITED WITH MORE [PHP](scrolls/PHP) SCRIPTS, ALL CALLED WITH [JAVASCRIPT](scrolls/JAVASCRIPT) FROM THE [HTML](scrolls/HTML) DOCUMENT YOU ARE READING! 

EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED IN MARKDOWN FILES, WHICH ARE ALL ALSO COPIED BY THE REPLICATOR SCRIPTS!
