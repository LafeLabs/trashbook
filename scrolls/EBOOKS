# FREE EBOOKS
 
THIS RIGHT HERE DOCUMENT THAT YOU ARE READING IS A FREE EBOOK! IT IS SELF-REPLICATING!

THIS DOCUMENT IS A SELF REPLICATING SET OF FILES MADE FROM THE FIVE LANGUAGES OF 

 - [HTML](scrolls/HTML)
 - [CSS](scrolls/CSS)
 - [JAVASCRIPT](scrolls/JAVASCRIPT)
 - [PHP](scrolls/PHP)
 - [MARKDOWN ](scrolls/MARKDOWN)

A [PHP SCRIPT](php/replicator.txt) REPLICATES THE SET, AND A [JSON FILE](data/dna.txt) DESCRIBES THE SET.

PHP PROGRAMS EDIT ALL THE FILES LIVE ON ANY GIVEN SERVER!

THEN THE NEXT SERVER CAN FETCH EACH INSTANCE OF THE BOOK!

AND THE BOOK CAN SAY "GO MAKE MORE WEB SERVERS AND PUT TRASH MAGIC ON THEM"! 

AND THEN THERE WILL BE MORE SERVERS!

PEOPLE CAN MAKE SERVERS FROM ANY COMPUTER OR EVEN A TABLET OR MOBILE PHONE!

SERVERS CAN BE ON A CLEAN AND FREE LINUX BOX WHICH CAN BE ON ANY DONATED HARDWARE, OR THEY CAN BE GUERILLA SERVERS THAT RUN ON EXISTING PRIVATE HARDWARE SUCH AS ON EASYDNS.COM OR ON WORK COMPUTERS ON A VPN OR ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS IN PRIVATE SPACES!

THE E BOOK ON EACH SERVER REPLICATES THE SERVERS!

AS THE SERVERS REPLICATE, THE E BOOK REPLICATES!

WE CAN BUILD A BILLION SERVERS THIS WAY!
