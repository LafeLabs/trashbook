THE LIBRARIES THAT WE USE IN TRASH MAGIC ARE ALL GLOBALLY AVAILABLE SETS OF CODE THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD WIDE  WEB CAN ALL USE FOR FREE!

THESE ARE ALL TOTALLY FREE APPS THAT CAN RUN ON ANY MACHINE!

TOGETHER, THEY DO ALL THE MAGIC THAT IS REQUIRED FOR TRASH MAGIC TO RUN!

 THE MAIN LIBRARY USED TO CREATE THIS BOOK IS [SHOWDOWN.JS](https://showdownjs.com/), WHICH CONVERTS [MARKDOWN](scrolls/MARKDOWN) TO [HTML](scrolls/HTML)!

IF WE WANT TO TYPE SET MATH, WE CAN USE THE [MATHJAX.JS](https://www.mathjax.org/) LIBRARY WHICH CONVERTS [LATEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) SYNTAX INTO HTML!

ALL THE QR CODES IN THE SYSTEM ARE MADE USING [QRCODE.JS](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/)!

ICONS ARE CREATED USING THE [GEOEMTRON.JS](geometron.js) JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY, WRITTEN BY [TRASH ROBOT](HTTPS://TRASHROBOT.NET), AND DOCUMENTED IN THE BOOKS OF GEOMETRON, WHICH ARE USUALLY REPLICATED IN SETS OF TRASH MAGIC BOOKS!

TRASH MAGIC PAGES CAN BE MADE USING RAINBOWS AND GOOGLEY EYES VIA THE JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY [TRASHMAGIC.JS](trashmagic.js)!

CODE EDITORS IN TRASH MAGIC ARE BUILT USING THE JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY [ACE.JS](https://ace.c9.io/)!
