PHP IS THE LANGUAGE WHICH LETS US TALK FROM THE FRONT END OF THE WEB BROWSER WHERE YOU ARE TO THE BACK END WHERE THE ACTUAL SERVER IS!

THIS IS HOW WE CAN ALL USE THE POWER OF THE MACHINES THAT ARE THE SERVERS!

WE USE A FEW SMALL PHP PROGRAMS TO MAKE ALL THIS WORK!

BELOW ARE SOME LINKS ABOUT PHP AND A LINK TO THE PHP EDITOR ON THIS SERVER AND TO THE  PHP PROGRAMS THAT MAKE THIS SYSTEM WORK!

PHP IS PART OF THE SO-CALLED "[LAMP STACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle))" WHICH ALLOWS MUCH OF THE WEB TO WORK, AS WELL AS THE "LARP STACK" WHICH IS WHAT RUNS THIS BOOK!
