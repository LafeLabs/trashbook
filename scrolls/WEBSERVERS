BUILD WEB SERVERS ON PRIVATE COMPUTERS TO DISTRIBUTE IN PRIVATE NETWORKS OR BUILD FULLY FREE TRASH MAGIC SERVERS BY TAKING OLD DONATED HARDWARE AND INSTALLING LINUX AND APACHE AND PHP AND TRASH MAGIC AND BUILDING A FULLY FREE NETWORK OF WEB SERVERS!

WEB SERVERS THAT ARE FULLY FREE TRASH MAGIC SERVERS WILL GET WIFI CONNECTIONS USING DONATED ROUTERS TO CREATE MESH NETWORKS WHICH FORM LOCAL NETWORKS WHICH CAN HOST ALL THE CONTENT ON ALL THE LOCAL TRASH MAGIC SERVERS!
 
WHEN WE HAVE A SUPPLY OF TRASH MAGIC SERVERS, WE WILL PUT THEM IN SHOPPING CARTS AND PUSH THEM ALONG THE NETWORKS OF THE STREET AND THE WATERSHED TO DISTRIBUTE THE MEDIA!
