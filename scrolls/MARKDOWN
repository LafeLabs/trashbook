# MARKDOWN
 
MARKDOWN WIDELY USED LANGUAGE FOR ADDING FORMAT TO DOCUMENTS WITH PURE TEXT, WITHOUT NEEDING SO MUCH FANCY SOFTWARE! 

MARKDOWN IS USED BY THE SO-CALLED "README.MD" FILE THAT IS USED TO DOCUMENT MANY OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS!

THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN IN MARKDOWN!

MARKDOWN IS CONVERTED INTO HTML USING THE [JAVASCRIPT](scrolls/JAVASCRIPT) [LIBRARY](scrolls/JSLIBRARIES) [SHOWDOWN.JS](https://showdownjs.com/).  

MARKDOWN IS BUILT INTO THE POPULAR [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Githttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) REPOSITORY OWNED BY [MICROSOFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) CALLED [GITHUB](https://github.com/).
