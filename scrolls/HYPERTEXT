TRASH CAN BE HYPERTEXT! 

WHEN WE PUT URLS ON TRASH THAT POINT TO WEB RESOURCES WHICH POINT BACK TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD, WE MAKE TRASH INTO A HYPERTEXT NETWORK OUT ON THE STREETS!

PRINT OUT QR CODES WITH A URL AND CUT THEM OUT AND PASTE THEM WITH GLUE OR WHEAT PASTE ONTO TRASH! 

THE TRASH POINTS TO THE URL WHICH POINTS TO THE SERVER WHICH POINTS TO THE SPACE WITH THE TRASH IN IT!

YOU CAN LINK TO OPEN STREET MAP DOT ORG, WITH SPECIFIC COORDINATES THAT MAP TO THE TRASH WHICH POINTS BACK TO THE PAGE, MAKING THE TRASH AN EXTENSION OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB OUT ONTO THE STREETS!

THIS IS THE TRASH MAGIC NETWORK!

TRASH IS HYPERTEXT!


THIS IS HYPERTRASH!
