## The Parable.

In an old book I discovered an extraordinary narrative entitled Parabola.
I take it as the starting point of my observations because it affords a
welcome guide. In the endeavor to understand the parable and get a
psychological insight into it, we are led on to journey through these very
realms of fancy, into which I should like to conduct the reader. At the
end of our journey we shall have acquired, with the understanding of the
first example, the knowledge of certain psychical laws.

I shall, then, without further prelude introduce the example, and
purposely avoid at the outset mentioning the title of the old book so that
the reader may be in a position to allow the narrative to affect him
without any preconceived ideas. Explanatory interpolations in the text,
which come from me, I distinguish with square brackets.


    [1]. As once I strolled in a fair forest, young and green, and
    contemplated the painfulness of this life, and lamented how
    through the dire fall of our first parents we inherited such
    misery and distress, I chanced, while thinking these thoughts, to
    depart from the usual path, and found myself, I know not how, on a
    narrow foot path that was rough, untrodden and impassable, and
    overgrown with so much underbrush and bushes that it was easy to
    see it was very little used. Therefore I was dismayed and would
    gladly have gone back, but it was not in my power to do so, since
    a strong wind so powerfully blew me on, that I could rather take
    ten steps in advance than one backward.

    [2]. Therefore I had to go on and not mind the rough walking.

    [3]. After I had advanced a good while I came finally to a lovely
    meadow hedged about with a round circle of fruit bearing trees,
    and called by the dwellers _Pratum felicitatis_ [the meadow of
    felicity], I was in the midst of a company of old men with beards
    as gray as ice, except for one who was quite a young man with a
    pointed black beard. Also there was among them one whose name was
    well known to me, but his visage I could not yet see, who was
    still younger, and they debated on all kinds of subjects,
    particularly about a great and lofty mystery, hidden in Nature,
    which God kept concealed from the great world, and revealed to
    only a few who loved him.

    [4]. I listened long and their discourse pleased me well, only
    some would break forth from restraint, not touching upon the
    matter or work, but what touched upon the parables, similitudes
    and other parerga, in which they followed the poetic fancies of
    Aristotle, Pliny and others which the one had copied from the
    other. So I could contain myself no longer and mixed in my own
    mustard, [put in my own word], refuted such trivial things from
    experience, and the majority sided with me, examined me in their
    faculty and made it quite hot for me. However the foundation of my
    knowledge was so good, that I passed with all honors, whereupon
    they all were amazed, unanimously included and admitted me in
    their collegium, of which I was heartily glad.

    [5]. But they said I could not be a real colleague till I learned
    to know their lion, and became thoroughly acquainted with his
    powers and abilities. For that purpose I should use diligence so
    as to subdue him. I was quite confident in myself and promised
    them I would do my best. For their company pleased me so well that
    I would not have parted from them for a great deal.

    [6]. They led me to the lion and described him very carefully, but
    what I should undertake with him none could tell me. Some of them
    indeed hinted, but very darkly, so that the (Der Tausende)
    Thousandth one could not have understood him. But when I should
    first succeed in subduing him and should have assured myself
    against his sharp claws, and keen teeth, then they would conceal
    nothing from me. Now the lion was very old, ferocious and large,
    his yellow hair hung over his neck, he appeared quite
    unconquerable, so that I was almost afraid of my temerity and
    would gladly have turned back if my promise and also the
    circumstance that the elders stood about me and were waiting to
    see what I would do, had allowed me to give up. In great
    confidence I approached the lion in his den and began to caress
    him, but he looked at me so fiercely with his brightly shining
    eyes that I could hardly restrain my tears. Just then I remembered
    that I had learned from one of the elders, while we were going to
    the lion’s den, that very many people had undertaken to overcome
    the lion and very few could accomplish it. I was unwilling to be
    disgraced, and I recalled several grips that I had learned with
    great diligence in athletics, besides which I was well versed in
    natural magic [magia] so I gave up the caresses and seized the
    lion so dextrously, artfully and subtlely, that before he was well
    aware of it I forced the blood out of his body, yea, even out of
    his heart. It was beautifully red but very choleric. I dissected
    him further and found, a fact which caused me much wonder, that
    his bones were white as snow and there was much more bone than
    there was blood.

    [7]. Now when my dear elders, who stood above around the den and
    looked at me, were aware of it, they disputed earnestly with each
    other, for so much I could infer from their motions but what they
    said I could not hear since I was deep down in the den. Yet as
    they came close in dispute I heard that one said, “He must bring
    him to life again, else he can not be our colleague.” I was
    unwilling to undertake further difficulties, and betook myself out
    of the den to a great place, and came, I know not how, on a very
    high wall, whose height rose over 100 ells towards the clouds, but
    on top was not one foot wide. And there went up from the
    beginning, where I ascended, to the end an iron hand rail right
    along the center of the wall, with many leaded supports. On this
    wall I came, I say, and meseems there went on the right side of
    the railing a man several paces before me.

    [8]. But as I followed him awhile I saw another following me on
    the other side, yet it was doubtful whether man or woman, that
    called to me and said that it was better walking on his side than
    where I went, as I readily believed, because the railing that
    stood near the middle made the path so narrow that the going at
    such a height was very bad. Then I saw also some that wished to go
    on that path, fall: down below behind me, therefore I swung under
    the railing; holding tight with my hands and went forward on the
    other [left] side, till I finally came to a place on the wall
    which was very precipitous and dangerous to descend. Then first I
    repented that I had not stayed on the other [right] side and I
    could not go under to the other side as it was also impossible to
    turn round and get on the other path. So I risked it, trusted to
    my good feet, held myself tight and came down without harm, and as
    I walked a little further, looked and knew of no other danger, but
    also knew not what had become of wall and railing.

    [9]. After I came down, there stood in that place a beautiful rose
    bush, on which beautiful red and white roses were growing, the red
    more numerous, however, than the white. I broke off some roses
    from the bush and put them on my hat. But there seemed to be in
    the same place a wall, surrounding a great garden. In the garden
    were lads, and their lasses who would gladly be in the garden, but
    would not wander widely, or take the trouble to come to the gates.
    So I pitied them. I went further along the path by which I had
    come, still on the level, and went so fast that I soon came to
    some houses, where I supposed I should find the gardener’s house.
    But I found there many people, each having his own room. They were
    slow. Two together they worked diligently, yet each had his own
    work. [The meaning may be either that working alone they were
    slow, but in twos they worked diligently; or two of them worked
    together and were diligent. Both amount to the same thing as we
    shall later realize.] But what they did, it seems, I had myself
    done before and all their work was familiar to me. Especially,
    thought I, see, if so many other people do so much dirty and
    sloppy work, that is only an appearance according to each one’s
    conceit, but has no reason in Nature, so it may also be pardoned
    in you. I wished, therefore, because I knew such tricks vanished
    like smoke, to remain here no longer in vain and proceeded on my
    former way.

    [10]. After I had arrived at the gate of the garden, some on one
    side looked sourly at me, so that I was afraid they might hinder
    me in my project; but others said, “See, he will into the garden,
    and we have done garden service here so long, and have never
    gotten in; we will laugh him down if he fails.” But I did not
    regard all that, as I knew the conditions of this garden better
    than they, even if I had never been in it, but went right to a
    gate that was tight shut so that one could neither see nor find a
    keyhole. I noticed, however, that a little round hole that with
    ordinary eyes could not be seen, was in the door, and thought
    immediately, that must be the way the door is opened, was ready
    with my specially prepared Diederich, unlocked and went in. When I
    was inside the door, I found several other bolted doors, which I
    yet opened without trouble. Here, however, was a passage way, just
    as if it was in a well built house, some six feet wide and twenty
    long, with a roof above. And though the other doors were still
    locked, I could easily see through them into the garden as the
    first door was open.

    [11]. I wandered into the garden in God’s name, and found in the
    midst of it a small garden, that was square and six roods long,
    hedged in with rose thorns, and the roses bloomed beautifully. But
    as it was raining gently, and the sun shone in it, it caused a
    very lovely rainbow. When I had passed beyond the little garden
    and would go to the place where I was to help the maids, behold I
    was aware that instead of the walls a low hurdle stood there, and
    there went along by the rose garden the most beautiful maiden
    arrayed in white satin, with the most stately youth, who was in
    scarlet each giving arm to the other, and carrying in their hands
    many fragrant roses. I spoke to them and asked them how they had
    come over the hurdle. “This, my beloved bridegroom,” said she,
    “has helped me over, and we are going now out of this beautiful
    garden into our apartment to enjoy the pleasures of love.” “I am
    glad,” said I, “that without any further trouble on my part your
    desires are satisfied; yet see how I have hurried, and have run so
    long a way in so short a time to serve you.” After that I came
    into a great mill built inside of stones, in which were no flour
    bins or other things that pertained to grinding but one saw
    through the walls several water wheels going in water. I asked why
    it had equipment for grinding. An old miller answered that the
    mill was shut down on the other side. Just then I also saw a
    miller’s boy go in from the sluice plank [Schutzensteg], and I
    followed after him. When I had come over the plank [Steg], which
    had the water wheels on the left, I stood still and was amazed at
    what I saw there. For the wheels were now higher than the plank,
    the water coal black, but its drops were yet white, and the sluice
    planks were not over three fingers wide. Still I ventured back and
    held onto the sticks that were over the sluice planks and so came
    safely and dry over the water. Then I asked the old miller how
    many water wheels he had. “Ten,” answered he. The adventure stuck
    in my mind. I should have gladly known what the meaning was. But
    as I noticed that the miller would not leave I went away, and
    there was in front of the mill a lofty paved hill, on which were
    some of the previously mentioned elders who walked in the sun,
    which then shone very warm, and they had a letter from the whole
    faculty written to them, on which they were consulting. [In our
    modern mode of expression, the elders had directed a letter to the
    sun, and so I find the passage in an English version of the
    parable. This generally bungling translation is nevertheless not
    in the least authoritative. And although an acceptable meaning is
    derived from it, if one regards the sun as the just mentioned
    “prince,” yet I believe a freer translation should be given ...
    the elders walked in the warm sunshine; they consulted about a
    letter written to them by the faculty.] I soon noticed what the
    contents must be, and that it concerned me. I went therefore to
    them and said, “Gentlemen, does it concern me?” “Yes,” said they,
    “you must keep in marriage the woman that you have recently taken
    or we must notify our prince.” I said, “that is no trouble as I
    was born at the same time as she and brought up as a child with
    her, and as I have taken her once I will keep her forever, and
    death itself shall not part us, for I have an ardent affection for
    her.” “What have we then to complain of?” replied they. “The bride
    is content, and we have your will; you must copulate.”
    “Contented,” said I. “Well,” said one, “the lion will then regain
    his life and become more powerful and mighty than before.”

    [12]. Then occurred to me my previous trouble and labor and I
    thought to myself that for particular reasons it must not concern
    me but some other that is well known to me; then I saw our
    bridegroom and his bride go by in their previous attire, ready and
    prepared for copulation, which gave me great joy, for I was in
    great distress lest the thing might concern me.

    [13]. When, then, as mentioned, our bridegroom in his brilliant
    scarlet clothes with his dearest bride, whose white satin coat
    shot forth bright rays, came to the proper marriage age, they
    joined the two so quickly that I wondered not a little that this
    maid, that was supposed to be the mother of the bridegroom, was
    still so young that she appeared to be just born.

    [14]. Now I do not know what sin these two must have committed
    except that although they were brother and sister, they were in
    such wise bound by ties of love, that they could not be separated,
    and so, as it were, wished to be punished for incest. These two
    were, instead of a bride bed and magnificent marriage, condemned
    and shut up in an enduring and everlasting prison, which, because
    of their high birth and goodly state, and also so that in future
    they should not be guilty in secret, but all their conduct should
    be known to the guard placed over them and in his sight, was made
    quite transparent, bright and clear like a crystal, and round like
    a sphere of heaven, and there they were with continual tears and
    true contrition to atone and make reparation for their past
    misdeeds. [Instead of to a bride bed the two were brought to a
    prison, so that their actions could be watched. The prison was
    transparent; it was a bright crystal clear chamber, like a sphere
    of heaven, corresponding to the high position of the two persons.]
    Previously, however, all their rare clothing and finery that they
    had put on for ornament was taken away, so that in such a chamber
    they must be quite naked and merely dwell with each other. [It is
    not directly understood by these words that a cohabitation in
    modern sense (coition) is meant. According to modern language the
    passage must be rendered, “had to dwell near each other naked and
    bare.” One is reminded, moreover, of the nuptial customs that are
    observed particularly in the marriage of persons of high birth. In
    any case and, in spite of my reservation, what occurs is conducive
    or designed to lead to the sexual union.] Besides they gave them
    no one that had to go into the chamber to wait on them, but after
    they put in all the necessities in the way of meat and drink,
    which were created from the afore mentioned water, the door of the
    chamber was fast bolted and locked, the faculty seal impressed on
    it and I was enjoined that I should guard them here, and spend the
    winter before the door; the chamber should be duly warmed so that
    they be neither too hot nor too cold, and they could neither come
    out nor escape. But should they, on account of any hope of
    breaking this mandate, escape, I would thereupon be justly
    subjected to heavy punishment. I was not pleased by the thing, my
    fear and solicitude made me faint hearted, for I communed with
    myself that it was no small thing that had befallen me, as I knew
    also that the college of wisdom was accustomed not to lie but to
    put into action what it said. Yet because I could not change it,
    beside which this locked chamber stood in the center of a strong
    tower and surrounded with strong bulwarks and high walls, in which
    one could with a small but continuous fire warm the whole chamber,
    I undertook this office, and began in God’s name to warm the
    chamber, and protect the imprisoned pair from the cold. But what
    happened? As soon as they perceived the slightest warmth they
    embraced each other so tenderly that the like will not soon be
    seen, and stayed so hot that the young bridegroom’s heart in his
    body dissolved for ardent love, also his whole body almost melted
    in his beloved’s arms and fell apart. When she who loved him no
    less than he did her, saw this, she wept over him passionately
    and, as it were buried him with her tears so that one could not
    see, for her gushing tears that overflowed everything, where he
    went. Her weeping and sorrowing had driven her to this in a short
    time, and she would not for deep anguish of heart live longer, but
    voluntarily gave herself to death. Ah woe is me. In what pain and
    need and trouble was I that my two charges had quite disappeared
    in water, and death alone was left for me. My certain destruction
    stood before my eyes, and what was the greatest hardship to me, I
    feared the threatened shame and disgrace that would happen to me,
    more than the injury that would overtake me.

    [15]. As I now passed several days in such solitude and pondered
    over the question how I could remedy my affairs, it occurred to me
    how Medea had revived the dead body of Aeson, and I thought to
    myself, “If Medea could do such a thing, why should such a thing
    fail me?” I began at once to bethink me how I would do it, found
    however no better way than that I should persist with continual
    warmth until the waters disappeared, and I might see again the
    corpses of our lovers. As I hoped to come off without danger and
    with great advantage and praise I went on with my warmth that I
    had begun and continued it forty whole days, as I was aware that
    the water kept on diminishing the longer I kept it up, and the
    corpses that were yet as black as coal, began again to be visible.
    And truly this would have occurred before if the chamber had not
    been all too securely locked and bolted. Which I yet did not avail
    to open. For I noted particularly that the water that rose and
    hastened to the clouds, collected above in the chamber and fell
    down like rain, so that nothing could come of it, until our
    bridegroom with his dearest bride, dead and rotten, and therefore
    hideously stinking, lay before my eyes.

    All the while the sunshine in the moist weather caused an
    exceedingly beautiful rainbow to be seen, in the chamber, with
    surprisingly beautiful colors, which overjoyed not a little my
    overpowering affliction. Much more was I delighted that I saw my
    two lovers lying before me again. But as no joy is so great but is
    mixed with much sadness, so I was troubled in my joy thinking that
    my charges lay still dead before me, and one could trace no life
    in them. But because I knew that their chamber was made of such
    pure and thick material, also so tight-locked that their soul and
    spirit could not get out, but was still closely guarded within, I
    continued with my steady warmth day and night, to perform my
    delegated office, quite impressed with the fact that the two would
    not return to their bodies, as long as the moisture continued. For
    in the moist state nature keeps itself the same, as I then also
    found in fact and in truth. For I was aware upon careful
    examination that from the earth at evening through the power of
    the sun, many vapors arose and drew themselves up just as the sun
    draws water. They were condensed in the night in a lovely and very
    fruitful dew, which very early in the morning fell and moistened
    the earth and washed our dead corpses, so that from day to day,
    the longer such bathing and washing continued, the more beautiful
    and whiter they became. But the fairer and whiter they became, the
    more they lost moisture, till finally the air being bright and
    beautiful, and all the mist and moist weather, having passed, the
    spirit and soul of the bride could hold itself no longer in the
    bright air, but went back into the clarified and still more
    transfigured body of the queen, who soon experienced it [i.e. her
    soul and spirit] and at once lived again. This, then, as I could
    easily observe, not a little pleased me, especially as I saw her
    arise in surpassingly costly garments whose like was never seen on
    earth, and with a precious crown decked with bright diamonds; and
    also heard her speak. “Hear ye children of men and perceive ye
    that are born of women, that the most high power can set up kings
    and can remove kings. He makes rich and poor, according to his
    will. He kills and makes again to live.”

    [16]. See in me a true and living example of all that. I was great
    and became small, but now after having been humbled, I am a queen
    elevated over many kingdoms. I have been killed and made to live.
    To poor me have been trusted and given over the great treasures of
    the sages and the mighty.

    [17]. “Therefore power is also given me to make the poor rich,
    show kindness to the lowly, and bring health to the sick. But I am
    not yet like my well-beloved brother, the great and powerful king,
    who is still to be awakened from the dead. When he comes he will
    prove that my words are true.”

    [18]. And when she said that the sun shone very bright, and the
    day was warmer than before, and the dog days were at hand. But
    because, a long time before, there were prepared for the lordly
    and great wedding of our new queen many costly robes, as of black
    velvet, ashen damask, gray silk, silver taffeta, snow white satin,
    even one studded with surpassingly beautiful silver pieces and
    with precious pearls and lordly bright-gleaming diamonds, so
    likewise different garments were arranged and prepared for the
    young king, namely of carnation, yellow Auranian colors, precious
    gear, and finally a red velvet garment with precious rubies and
    thickly incrusted with carbuncles. But the tailors that made their
    clothes were quite invisible, so that I also wondered as I saw one
    coat prepared after another and one garment after another, how
    these things came to pass, since I well knew that no one came into
    the chamber except the bridegroom with his bride. So that what I
    wondered at most of all was that as soon as another coat or
    garment was ready, the first immediately vanished before my eyes,
    so that I knew not whence they came or who had taken them away.

    [19]. When now this precious clothing was ready, the great and
    mighty king appeared in great splendor and magnificence, to which
    nothing might be compared. And when he found himself shut in, he
    begged me with friendly and very gracious words, to open the door
    for him and permit him to go out; it would prove of great
    advantage to me. Although I was strictly forbidden to open the
    chamber, yet the grand appearance and the winning persuasiveness
    of the king disconcerted me so that I cheerfully let him go. And
    when he went out he was so friendly and so gracious and yet so
    meek that he proved indeed that nothing did so grace high persons
    as did these virtues.

    [20]. But because he had passed the dog days in great heat, he was
    very thirsty, also faint and tired and directed me to dip up some
    of the swift running water under the mill wheels, and bring it,
    and when I did, he drank a large part with great eagerness, went
    back into his chamber, and bade me close the door fast behind him,
    so that no one might disturb him or wake him from sleep.

    [21]. Here he rested for a few days and called to me to open the
    door. Methought, however, that he was much more beautiful, more
    ruddy and lordly, which he then also remarked and deemed it a
    lordly and wholesome water, drank much of it, more than before so
    that I was resolved to build the chamber much larger. [Evidently
    because the inmate increased in size.] When now the king had drunk
    to his satisfaction of this precious drink, which yet the
    unknowing regard as nothing he became so beautiful and lordly,
    that in my whole life I never saw a more lordly person nor more
    lordly demeanor. Then he led me into his kingdom, and showed me
    all the treasures and riches of the world, so that I must confess,
    that not only had the queen announced the truth, but also had
    omitted to describe the greater part of it as it seemed to those
    that know it. For there was no end of gold and noble carbuncle
    there; rejuvenation and restoration of natural forces, and also
    recovery of lost health, and removal of all diseases were a common
    thing in that place. The most precious of all was that the people
    of that land knew their creator, feared and honored him, and asked
    of him wisdom and understanding, and finally after this transitory
    glory an everlasting blessedness. To that end help us God the
    Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.


The author of the preceding narrative calls it a parable. Its significance
may have indeed appeared quite transparent to him, and he presupposes that
the readers of his day knew what form of learning he masked in it. The
story impresses us as rather a fairy story or a picturesque dream. If we
compare parables that come nearer to our modern point of view and are
easily understood on account of their simplicity, like those of Ruckert or
those of the New Testament, the difference can be clearly seen. The
unnamed author evidently pursues a definite aim; one does find some unity
in the bizarre confusion of his ideas; but what he is aiming at and what
he wishes to tell us with his images we cannot immediately conceive. The
main fact for us is that the anonymous writer speaks in a language that
shows decided affinity with that of dreams and myths. Therefore, however
we may explain in what follows the peculiarly visionary character of the
parable, we feel compelled to examine it with the help of a psychological
method, which, endeavoring to get from the surface to the depths, will be
able to trace analytically the formative powers of the dream life and
allied phenomena, and explain their mysterious symbols.

I have still to reveal in what book and in what circumstances the parable
appears. It is in the second volume of a book “Geheime Figuren der
Rosenkreuzer aus dem 16ten und 17ten Jahrhundert,” published at Altona
about 1785-90. Its chief contents are large plates with pictorial
representations and with them a number of pages of text. According to a
note on the title page, the contents are “for the first time brought to
light from an old manuscript.” The parable is in the second volume of a
three-volume series which bears the subtitle: Ein güldener Tractat vom
philosophischen Steine. Von einem noch lebenden, doch ungenannten
Philosopho, den Filiis doctrinae zur Lehre, den Fratribus Aureae Crucis
aber zur Nachrichtung beschrieben. Anno, M.D.C.XXV.

If I add that this book is an hermetic treatise (alchemistic), it may
furnish a general classification for it, but will hardly give any definite
idea of its nature, not merely on account of the oblivion into which this
kind of writing has now fallen, but also because the few ideas usually
connected with it produce a distorted picture. The hermetic art, as it is
treated here, the principles of which strike us to-day as fantastic, is
related to several “secret” sciences and organizations, some of which have
been discredited: magic, kabbala, rosicrucianism, etc. It is particularly
closely connected with alchemy so that the terms “hermetic art” and
“alchemy” (and even “royal art”) are often used synonymously. This
“art”—to call it by the name that not without some justification it
applies to itself—leads us by virtue of its many ramifications into a
large number of provinces, which furnish us desirable material for our
research.

So I will first, purposely advancing on one line, regard the parable as a
dream or a fairy tale and analyze it psychoanalytically. This treatment
will, for the information of the reader, be preceded by a short exposition
of psychoanalysis as a method of interpretation of dreams and fairy tales.
Then I will, still seeking for the roots of the matter, introduce the
doctrines that the pictorial language of the parable symbolizes. I will
give consideration to the chemical viewpoint of alchemy and also the
hermetic philosophy and its hieroglyphic educational methods.

Connections will be developed with religious and ethical topics, and we
shall have to take into account the historical and psychological relations
of hermetic thought with rosicrucianism in its various forms, and
freemasonry. And when we begin, at the conclusion of the analytical
section of my work, to apply to the solution of our parable and of several
folk tales the insight we have gained, we shall be confronted with a
problem in which we shall face two apparently contradictory
interpretations, according to whether we follow the lead of psychoanalysis
or of the hermetic, hieroglyphic solution. The question will then arise
whether and how the contradiction occurs. How shall we bring into relation
with each other and reconcile the two different interpretations which are
quite different and complete in themselves?

The question arising from the several illustrations expands into a general
problem, to which the synthetic part of my book is devoted. This will,
among other considerations, lead us into the psychology of symbol-making
where again the discoveries of psychoanalysis come to our aid. We shall
not be satisfied with analysis, but endeavor to follow up certain
evolutionary tendencies which, expressed in psychological symbols,
developing according to natural laws, will allow us to conjecture a
spiritual building up or progression that one might call an anabasis. We
shall see plainly by this method of study how the original contradiction
arises and how what was previously irreconcilable, turns out to be two
poles of an evolutionary process. By that means, several principles of
myth interpretation will be derived.

I have just spoken of an anabasis. By that we are to understand a forward
movement in a moral or religious sense. The most intensive exemplar of the
anabasis (whatever this may be) is mysticism. I can but grope about in the
psychology of mysticism; I trust I may have more confidence at that point
where I look at its symbolism from the ethical point of view.
